# FakeNewsDetectionDataAnalysis
This repository contains the EDA applied to the models defined at [FakeNewsDetectionModel](https://github.com/pegea20/FakeNewsDetectionModel)

We warn the users that the content analyzed is Spanish, since it was the target of this whole project.

This repository consists of three folders. The first folder, **'data'**, contains all the tables that need to be loaded into the notebooks found in the other two folders.

The second folder, **'data\_reorganization'**, shows an important step in the reorganization of the data during the project. To work more effectively with the data, we first combined all the tables into a single one in **'join\_tables'**, and then split that table into two — one for real news and another for fake news — in **'clusterize\_tables'**.

Finally, the last folder, **'eda'**, contains two exploratory data analyses: **'all\_variables\_analysis'**, which analyzes all the variables, and **'news\_text\_exploration'**, which focuses on analyzing the news text.
